THIS REPOSITORY EXISTS TO SHARE WAYS TO SAY "THANK YOU".

SO FAR THERE ARE ONLY TWO FILES - THIS README AND A TEXT 

DOCUMENT THAT LISTS "THANK YOU" IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES 

(WRITTEN SO THAT I CAN PRONOUNCE IT). THE RULE FOR UPDATING 

THIS DOCUMENT IS THAT I MUST LEARN THE WORD DIRECTLY FROM 

PEOPLE THAT SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE. NO LOOKING IT UP ON THE 

INTERNET! ANYONE IS WELCOME TO ADD DOCUMENTS / PROGRAMS 

THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE THEME OF "THANK YOU".
