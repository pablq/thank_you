THIS REPOSITORY EXISTS TO SHARE WAYS TO SAY "THANK YOU".

I HAVE BEGUN THE PROJECT WITH A SIMPLE TEXT DOCUMENT THAT

I'VE PUT TOGETHER OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS OR SO.  IT'S A

LIST OF TRANSLATIONS OF "THANK YOU" FROM ANY LANGUAGE TO

PHONETIC ENGLISH.  FEEL FREE TO ADD TO THE LIST (NO INTERNET

OR DICTIONARY LOOKUPS!), OR ADD ANY FILES AT ALL (CODE OR

NOT) THAT GO ALONG WITH THE IDEA OF SAYING "THANK YOU".
